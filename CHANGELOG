# v3.0.0
This release upgrades wbpy to account for various compatibility issues that had
become stale and/or broken over time. The bulk of the work was performed by
@bcipolli: https://github.com/mattduck/wbpy/pull/2.

- Add support for python 3.
- Drop support for python 2 (at least temporarily - may re-add if it's not much
  work).
- Support the v2 version of the API.
- Support pycountry versions > 18.12.8.


# v2.0.1
- Fix python 3 classifier syntax.

# v2.0
- Various components have been rewritten to simplify the API and make it easier
  to extend without breaking backwards compatibility. This release /does/ break
  backwards compatibility:
  - Indicators() is now IndicatorAPI(), Climate() now ClimateAPI().
  - For both APIs, the main data methods return custom models, rather than
     namedtuples.
  - get_country_indicators() becomes get_dataset(), and returns one dataset
    rather than multiple indicators.
  - Climate API is replaced with two methods, get_instrumental() and
    get_modelled().
  - Various API variables have been rearranged, eg. climate API code definitions.
- Supports python 2.6+ and python 3.
- Full tox test suite.
- Can access the raw JSON API responses.
- Fix handling of all non-ISO region codes (eg. A1) for the indicator API.
- The climate API has various simplifications, eg. removing GCM
  and ensemble parameters. The as_dict() method takes a "sres" arg, so the
  returned data only has one datum per year.
- Can return dictionary date keys as datetime objects rather than strings.
- Moving forwards, dataset models can be extended to return new formats (eg.
  pandas), without further breaking compatibility.
